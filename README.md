# WutEngine
A game engine written in as much Rust as possible

## Why?

Mostly to learn about game engine development and GPU rendering APIs at the same time.

## The Goal

An extensible cross-platform 2D and 3D game engine that is usable both through programming directly, and through
an editor (like the other big engines, Unity/Unreal/Godot/etc.).
