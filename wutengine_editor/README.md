# WutEngine Editor

The editor for [WutEngine](https://crates.io/crates/wutengine) games. Does nothing at the moment.
For progress, see the [main repository](https://github.com/cloone8/WutEngine).

## Note for crates.io

For the moment, no more updates for this library will be published. I don't think it makes sense to publish what will probably
be quite a large library to `crates.io`. Instead, to find out where to download the editor, see the [main repository](https://github.com/cloone8/WutEngine).
